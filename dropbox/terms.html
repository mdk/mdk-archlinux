	TO ALLOW DROPBOX TO ACCESS YOUR COMPUTER TO ACCESS ANY FILES THAT ARE PLACED IN
	THE 'MY DROPBOX,' 'DROPBOX' FOLDERS, AND/OR ANY OTHER FOLDER WHICH YOU CHOOSE
	TO LINK TO DROPBOX. BY PLACING FILES IN YOUR SHARED FOLDER, YOU CONSENT TO
	SHARE ACCESS TO THE CONTENT OF THOSE FOLDERS WITH THOSE OTHER DROPBOX USERS
	THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO UTILIZE THOSE FOLDERS. BY PLACING FILES IN YOUR
	PUBLIC FOLDERS, YOU CONSENT TO SHARE ACCESS TO THE CONTENT OF THOSE FOLDERS
	WITH OTHER DROPBOX USERS AND/OR THE PUBLIC. </span></p>



	<h2>Files and Folders</h2>

	<p><span>&#147;<b><i>Your
	Files</i></b><i>&#148; </i>or <i>&#147;<b>User Files</b>&#148;</i> (collectively, the &#147;<b><i>Files</i></b>&#148;)
	as used in this Agreement means the information contained in the files that you
	or other users upload, download and access through the Site and Services. </span>

	<span>You are the owner of Your Files and
	are solely responsible for your conduct and the content of Your Files, as well
	as any of the content contained in your communications with other Dropbox users,
	including but not limited to User Posts (as defined below).</span> </p>

	<p><span>Dropbox allows you to share some or all of Your Files.  If you
	choose to, you can share all or some of Your Files with the general public, or
	with specific individuals you select.  If you decide to share Your Files, you
	are giving certain legal rights, as explained below, to those individuals who
	you have given access to your folders. </span></p>



	<p><span>Dropbox does not claim any ownership rights in Your Files. You acknowledge
	that Dropbox does not have any obligation to monitor the Files or User Posts
	that are uploaded, posted, submitted, linked to or otherwise transmitted using
	the Site or Services, for any purpose and, as a result, is not responsible for
	the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, legality or applicability of the
	Files or anything said, depicted or written by users in their User Posts,
	including without limitation, any information obtained by using the Site or
	Services. Dropbox does not endorse anything contained in the Files or User
	Posts or any opinion, recommendation or advice expressed therein and you agree
	to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or equitable rights or remedies you
	have or may have against Dropbox with respect thereto.</span></p>

	<p><span>While you own the content contained in Your Files, files placed in
	your public folders are automatically available to other Dropbox users and to
	the general public. By placing Your Files in your public folder, you hereby
	grant all other Dropbox users and the public a non-exclusive, non-commercial,
	worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, perpetual and irrevocable right and
	license to use and exploit Your Files in your public folder.  In other words, a
	file in your public folder can be used by anyone, for any purpose <i>except</i>

	commercial use. If you do not want other people to be able to use Your Files in
	this manner, then simply do not place Your Files in your public folder. By
	placing Your Files in your public folder, </span><span>you </span><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>agree
	and acknowledge that Dropbox has no responsibility or obligation to monitor or
	notify of you of any non-compliance related to the license you have granted and

	<p><span>While you own the content contained in Your Files, files placed in
	your shared folders are available to those users to whom you grant access. By placing Your Files in your shared folder, you 
	agree and acknowledge that Dropbox
	has no responsibility or obligation to monitor or notify of you of any
	non-compliance related to the rights or license you may choose to grant to
	other users who have access to your shared folders, if any, and that Dropbox
	has no responsibility to enforce or police, or aid you in enforcing or
	policing, the terms of the license(s) or permission(s) you have chosen to
	offer.</span></p>

	<h2>Your Responsibilities </h2>


	<p><span>You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary
	licenses, rights, consents and permissions to grant the licenses that both your
	public and shared folders require, as described above. Please note that moving
	all or portions of Your Files from your public folders does not revoke the
	license granted to those individuals who previously accessed those files. </span></p>

	<p><span style='font-family:"Tahoma","sans-serif"'>You
	should be aware that Files may be protected by intellectual property rights
	which are owned by the Dropbox user whose folder (public or shared) that File
	resides in. You may not modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute or create
	derivative works based on the content(s) (either in whole or in part) of
	another user's shared folder unless you have been specifically told that you
	may do so by the rightful owner of that File, in a separate agreement.</span></p>

	Content, Files and<b> </b>Services for any reason. You further acknowledge and
	agree that you are solely responsible for maintaining and protecting all data
	and information that is stored, retrieved or otherwise processed by the Site,

		<h2>Account Pricing Terms and Conditions</h2>

		<h5>Premium Accounts</h5>
		<p>
			Dropbox offers you the option of increasing your account storage space beyond 2 GB for a fee. By doing so, your account will be converted to a Premium Account and will not be subject to the restrictions placed on Free Accounts as described below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dropbox accepts credit cards and will automatically charge your credit card monthly or yearly, depending upon which Premium Account you select. If any fee is not paid in a timely manner, or Dropbox is unable to process your transaction using the credit card information provided, Dropbox reserves the right to revoke access to your Dropbox account and Files. If you do not bring your Dropbox balance current within five (5) days after Dropbox provides you with notification that your account is in arrears, Dropbox reserves the right to use our discretion to delete some or all of Your Files so as to reduce your storage space to below 2 GB, and to convert your Dropbox Premium Account to a Free Account (which is subject to the restrictions described below).  
		</p>

		<h5>Billing</h5>
		<p>
			The fees for your Premium Account will be billed from the date you elect, or convert to,  a Premium Account and on each monthly or yearly renewal thereafter unless and until you cancel your account. Click on the link on your "Account" page to see the commencement date for your next renewal period. Dropbox will automatically bill your credit card each month or year on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your Premium Account. In the event your Premium Account began on a day not contained in a given month or year, Dropbox will bill your credit card on the last day of such month or year. For example, if your Premium Account began on January 31st, February 28th is the next time your credit card would be billed. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month or year may vary for reasons that include, differing amounts due to promotional offers, differing amounts due to changes in your account, or changes in the amount of applicable sales tax, and you authorize us to charge your credit card for such varying amounts. Dropbox may also periodically authorize your credit card in anticipation of account or related charges. All fees and charges are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. 
		</p>
		<p>	
			Should you elect to upgrade your Premium Account to a larger amount of storage space, the commencement date for your next renewal period will be reset and you will be billed for the first month or year of the upgraded level of service on a pro-rata basis. For example, if you begin your monthly billed Premium Account on February 15th, your next payment would be due on March 15th. On March 22, you upgrade your Premium Account to a larger amount of storage space and pay the new amount associated with the upgraded Premium Account you have selected, less the amount equal to 7 days at your previous Premium Account rate. Your next payment would then be due on April 22.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Dropbox may change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges from time to time, but we will give you advance notice of these changes by email. If you want to use a different credit card or if there is a change in your credit card validity or expiration date, you may edit your information by accessing your "Account" page. If your credit card reaches its expiration date, your continued use of the Dropbox constitutes your authorization for us to continue billing that credit card and you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information and payment information current and updated.
		</p>

		<h5>Cancelling Your Account</h5>
		<p>
			Your Dropbox Premium Account will continue in effect unless and until you cancel your Premium Account or we terminate it. You must cancel your Premium Account before it renews each month or year in order to avoid billing of the next month's or year's fees to your credit card. Dropbox will bill the monthly or yearly fees associated with your Premium Account plus any applicable tax to the credit card you provide to us during registration (or to a different credit card if you change your account information).
		</p>
		<p>
			Dropbox Premium Accounts are prepaid and are non-refundable. DROPBOX DOES NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL MONTHS OR YEARS. You may cancel your Dropbox Premium Account at anytime, and cancellation will be effective immediately. If you wish to cancel your Premium Account you may so via your "Account" page. Should you elect to cancel your Premium Account, please note that you will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged monthly fees.
		</p>

		<p>
			By signing up for a Dropbox Premium Account and providing Dropbox with your payment account information, you hereby agree to these payment terms and conditions.
		</p>

		<h5>Free Accounts</h5>
		<p>
			Dropbox allows you to store up to 2 GB free of charge.  Dropbox reserves the right to terminate Free Accounts at any time, with or without notice.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if a Free Account is inactive for ninety (90) days, then Dropbox may delete any or all of Your Files without providing additional notice.
		</p>
		<p>
			For further information regarding your Dropbox Premium or Free Account, please see the Dropbox  <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.
